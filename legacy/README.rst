UX-SAD's (Legacy) Documentation
===============================

This folder holds an old version of the bare-bone documentation that was used
to communicate internally in the team. Everything in this folder is either
available in the full documentation (the parent directory) or will be in the
future.

Everything in this folder is written using groff, but most of the documentation
should be compatible with the original troff. A Makefile is provided to build
all the documents with a single commands.

.. IMPORTANT::
   Please note that everything in this folder is kept only for back reference,
   and the information provided here is not in any way updated. We may use the
   content of this folder and update it for quickly obtaining documentations
   for internal use only.
